So inserting an element at given position will always have the time complexity of O(n) as both insert method and slicing has time complexity of O(n) and O(k). 
Only append which inserts at the end of list have O(1) time complexity. 

```python
some_list.insert(0, k) vs. some_list[-1]+some_list[:-1]
```

If you need to add/remove at both ends, consider using a collections.deque instead.
